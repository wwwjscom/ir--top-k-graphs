== Junit Jar ==
Be sure you have the full path to the junit jar in your classpath.  In this case:

export CLASSPATH=${CLASSPATH}:/home/soo/code

will suffice

== Java Packages ==
A common error, say I have
"package graphs;
import graphs.XX;"

This will fail if the directory these files are in is NOT called graphs.
